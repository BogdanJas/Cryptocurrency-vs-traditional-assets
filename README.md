# Research on Long-term Connections Between Cryptocurrencies and Traditional Financial Assets

## Overview

This research investigates whether cryptocurrencies have significant long-term connections with traditional financial assets, demonstrating stable relationships despite their volatility. Various tests were conducted to analyze these relationships and interactions.

## Methodology and Findings

### 1. Stationarity Tests
- **Initial Data Analysis:** The stationarity test on the original data indicated a price level trend, a common characteristic of financial data.
- **Differencing Data:** By differencing the original datasets, we focused on returns or changes in prices rather than levels. The Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test confirmed that the differenced data is stationary.

### 2. Cointegration Analysis
- **Assets Analyzed:** Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Gold, and S&P 500 (SP500).
- **Results:** The cointegration tests revealed a long-term equilibrium relationship among BTC, ETH, Gold, and SP500. Despite short-term fluctuations, these assets' prices tend to move together over the long term.

### 3. Vector Autoregression (VAR) Model
- **Purpose:** The VAR model was employed to capture the short-term interactions between the analyzed assets.
- **Findings:** The model effectively described the dynamic interdependencies and interactions over short periods.

### 4. Homoscedasticity and Serial Correlation Tests
- **Cryptocurrencies and Gold:** Tests indicated that both cryptocurrencies and Gold exhibit homoscedasticity (constant variance) and lack serial correlation.
- **S&P 500:** In contrast, the SP500 data demonstrated heteroscedasticity (variable variance) and serial correlation.

### 5. Ramsey RESET Test
- **Objective:** To verify the correctness of the model used for analysis.
- **Outcome:** The Ramsey RESET test confirmed that the model accurately represents the true underlying relationship between the analyzed assets.

## Conclusion

Based on the conducted tests and analysis, we conclude that our main hypothesis—cryptocurrencies have significant long-term connections with traditional financial assets, showing stable relationships despite their volatility—cannot be rejected. While there are short-term differences, the long-term connections are evident.
